                <mDescription>
                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <description>Content-property describing if a string content breaks to a new line</description>
        <descriptionfilespec>br (Break) 
This element specifies that a break shall be placed at the current location in the run content. A break is a special character which is used to override the normal line breaking that would be performed based on the normal layout of the document’s contents. *Example: Normal breaking for English would occur only after a breaking space or optional hyphen character. end example]  
The behavior of this break character (the location where text shall be restarted after this break) shall be determined by its type and clear attribute values, described below. 
Example: Consider the following sentence in a WordprocessingML document: 
This is a simple sentence. 
Normally, just as shown above, this sentence would be displayed on a single line as it is not long enough to require line breaking (given the width of the current page). However, if a text wrapping break character (a typical line break) were inserted after the word is, as follows: 
&lt;w:r&lt; 
  &lt;w:t&lt;This is&lt;/w:t&lt; 
  &lt;w:br/&lt; 
  &lt;w:t xml:space="preserve"&lt; a simple sentence.&lt;/w:t&lt; 
&lt;/w:r&lt; 
This would imply that this break shall be treated as a simple line break, and break the line after that word: 
This is 
 a simple sentence.

        <descriptionfilespec>caps (Display All Characters As Capital Letters) 
This element specifies that any lowercase characters in this text run shall be formatted for display only as their capital letter character equivalents. This property does not affect any non-alphabetic character in this run, and does not change the Unicode character for lowercase text, only the method in which it is displayed. 
This formatting property is a toggle property, which specifies that its behavior differs between its use within a style definition and its use as direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice versa). Setting it to false (or an equivalent) shall result in the current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as direct formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the absolute state of the resulting property.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then the characters are not formatted as capital letters. 
This element shall not be present with the smallCaps (§2.3.2.31) property on the same run, since they are mutually exclusive in terms of appearance. 
Example: Consider the words Hello World, which shall be displayed in all capital letters in a document. This constraint is specified as follows in the WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:r&lt; 
  &lt;w:rPr&lt; 
    &lt;w:caps w:val="true" /&lt; 
  &lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
  &lt;w:t&lt;Hello World&lt;/w:t&lt; 
&lt;/w:r&lt; 
This run will display as HELLO WORLD, even though the lowercase characters are used in the run contents due to the use of the caps element. If this property is removed, the original character forms will be displayed (they are not lost).

This element specifies that this cell is part of a horizontally merged set of cells in a table. The val attribute on this element determines how this cell is defined with respect to the previous cell in the table (i.e. does this cell continue the horizontal merge or start a new merged group of cells). 
[Note: This property is maintained for compatibility with legacy word processing documents which defined tables in this manner. Whenever possible, this form or horizontal merges should not be produced, and should be translated to the appropriate gridSpan (§2.4.13) settings on the table cells instead. end note] 
If this element is omitted, then this cell shall not be part of any horizontally merged grouping of cells, and any horizontal merge group in the preceding cells shall be closed. 
[Example: Consider a table with one row and three columns with the last two columns horizontally merged:

This element is used to draw an image that has been loaded from an external source.  There is an implied rectangle that is the same size as the image.  Any stroke or fill is applied to this implied rectangle.  The stroke is drawn on top of the image.  The fill is behind the image and therefore only visible through transparent areas of the image.  Image transparency is either encoded in the file or defined via a color value using the chromakey attribute.  Unlike the image element (§6.1.2.10), the imagedata element must have a parent element.

This element specifies the languages which shall be used to check spelling and grammar (if requested) when processing the contents of this run.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then the languages for the contents of this run shall be automatically determined based on their contents using any method desired. 
Example: Consider a run which contains both Latin and complex script characters in its contents. If those contents should be interpreted as French (Canada) and Hebrew, respectively, that requirement would be specified as follows in the resulting WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:r&lt; 
  &lt;w:rPr&lt;
    &lt;w:lang w:val="fr-CA" w:bidi="he-IL" /&lt; 
  &lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
&lt;/w:r&lt; 
The resulting run specifies that any complex script contents shall be spell and grammar checked as if they were Hebrew, and any Latin character contents shall be spell and grammar checked as if they were French (Canada).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

The size that is specified by this element affects the size of the pictures or table cells relative to the size of text in the document. The pixels per inch (ppi) measurement is relative to the screen resolution, and the resulting  physical dimensions of the resulting image or cell in pixels (which are used in web pages, but not for printed documents) are the result of the original dimensions (in inches) multiplied by the number of pixels per inch. 
The range of values for this element is typically from 19 to 480 pixels per inch. The common settings for popular screen sizes are 72, 96, and 120 pixels per inch. 
If this element is omitted, then a default size of 96 pixels per inch shall be used when determining the number of pixels for images and/or table cells within this document. 
[Note: This setting is typically only specified if the target screen resolution for the web page is known, as defined by the targetScreenSz element (§2.15.2.41) to set the optimum screen size for the web page. end note] [Example: Consider a WordprocessingML document which contains the following content within the web settings part:

        <descriptionfilespec>Right Paragraph Border
This element specifies the border which shall be displayed on the right side of the page around the specified paragraph. 
To determine if any two adjoining paragraphs should have a right border which spans the full line height or not, the right border shall be drawn between the top border or between border at the top (whichever would be rendered for the current paragraph), and the bottom border or between border at the bottom (whichever would be rendered for the current paragraph). 
If this element is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting previously set at any level of the style hierarchy (i.e. that previous setting remains unchanged). If this setting is never specified in the style hierarchy, then no right border shall be applied.
Example: &lt;w:right w:val="single" w:sz="24" w:space="4" w:color="C3D69B" w:themeColor="accent3" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;

        <descriptionfilespec>SmallCaps:
This element specifies that all small letter characters in this text run shall be formatted for display only as their capital letter character equivalents in a font size two points smaller than the actual font size specified for this text. This property does not affect any non-alphabetic character in this run, and does not change the Unicode character for lowercase text, only the method in which it is displayed. If this font cannot be made two point smaller than the current size, then it shall be displayed as the smallest possible font size in capital letters. 
This formatting property is a toggle property, which specifies that its behavior differs between its use within a style definition and its use as direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice versa). Setting it to false (or an equivalent) shall result in the current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as direct formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the absolute state of the resulting property.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then the characters are not formatted as capital letters.
Example:
&lt;w:r&lt; 
    &lt;w:sz w:val="24" /&lt; 
    &lt;w:smallCaps w:val="true" /&lt;

This element specifies that the contents of this run shall be displayed with a single horizontal line through the center of the line. 
This formatting property is a toggle property, which specifies that its behavior differs between its use within a style definition and its use as direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice versa). Setting it to false (or an equivalent) shall result in the current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as direct formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the absolute state of the resulting property.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then strikethrough shall not be applied to the contents of this run. 
This element shall not be present with the dstrike (§2.3.2.7) property on the same run, since they are mutually exclusive in terms of appearance. 
Example: Consider a run of text which shall have the strike property explicitly turned on for the contents of the 
run. This constraint is specified using the following WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:rPr&lt; 
  &lt;w:strike w:val="true"/&lt; 
&lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
This run explicitly declares that the strike property is true, so the contents of this run will have a single horizontal strikethrough line.

                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <descriptionfilespec>This simple type specifies a theme color to be applied to the current object. The specified theme color is a reference to one of the predefined theme colors, located in the document's Theme part, which allows color information to be set centrally in the document. 
[Example: Consider a set of borders configured to use the accent2 theme color, resulting in the following WordprocessingML markup: 
&lt;w:top … w:color="FFA8A0" w:themeColor="accent2" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;
&lt;w:bottom … w:color="FFA8A0" w:themeColor="accent2" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;

&lt;w:right … w:color="FFA8A0" w:themeColor="accent2" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;
The borders have a themeColor attribute of type ST_ThemeColor that when specified, imports the accent2 theme color specified for this document. end example] This simple type's contents are a restriction of the XML Schema string datatype. [cit. OOXML spec.]</descriptionfilespec>

This element specifies that the contents of this run should be displayed along with an underline appearing directly below the character height (less all spacing above and below the characters on the line).  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then an underline shall not be applied to the contents of this run. 
Example: Consider a run of text which shall have a double underline explicitly turned on for the contents of the run. This constraint is specified using the following WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:rPr&lt; 
  &lt;w:u w:val="double"/&lt; 
&lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
The val of the underline on this run is double, so the style of the underline on this run shall be a double line
This run explicitly declares an underline using the u property. The val of that underline is double, so the style of the underline on this run shall be a double line.
Possible Values:
