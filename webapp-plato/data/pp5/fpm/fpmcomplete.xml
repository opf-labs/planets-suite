                <mDescription>
                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <descriptionfilespec>br (Break) 
This element specifies that a break shall be placed at the current location in the run content. A break is a special character which is used to override the normal line breaking that would be performed based on the normal layout of the document’s contents. *Example: Normal breaking for English would occur only after a breaking space or optional hyphen character. end example]  
The behavior of this break character (the location where text shall be restarted after this break) shall be determined by its type and clear attribute values, described below. 
Example: Consider the following sentence in a WordprocessingML document: 
This is a simple sentence. 
Normally, just as shown above, this sentence would be displayed on a single line as it is not long enough to require line breaking (given the width of the current page). However, if a text wrapping break character (a typical line break) were inserted after the word is, as follows: 
&lt;w:r&lt; 
  &lt;w:t&lt;This is&lt;/w:t&lt; 
  &lt;w:br/&lt; 
  &lt;w:t xml:space="preserve"&lt; a simple sentence.&lt;/w:t&lt; 
&lt;/w:r&lt; 
This would imply that this break shall be treated as a simple line break, and break the line after that word: 
This is 
 a simple sentence.

        <descriptionfilespec>caps (Display All Characters As Capital Letters) 
This element specifies that any lowercase characters in this text run shall be formatted for display only as their capital letter character equivalents. This property does not affect any non-alphabetic character in this run, and does not change the Unicode character for lowercase text, only the method in which it is displayed. 
This formatting property is a toggle property, which specifies that its behavior differs between its use within a style definition and its use as direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice versa). Setting it to false (or an equivalent) shall result in the current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as direct formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the absolute state of the resulting property.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then the characters are not formatted as capital letters. 
This element shall not be present with the smallCaps (§2.3.2.31) property on the same run, since they are mutually exclusive in terms of appearance. 
Example: Consider the words Hello World, which shall be displayed in all capital letters in a document. This constraint is specified as follows in the WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:r&lt; 
  &lt;w:rPr&lt; 
    &lt;w:caps w:val="true" /&lt; 
  &lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
  &lt;w:t&lt;Hello World&lt;/w:t&lt; 
&lt;/w:r&lt; 
This run will display as HELLO WORLD, even though the lowercase characters are used in the run contents due to the use of the caps element. If this property is removed, the original character forms will be displayed (they are not lost).

This element specifies that this cell is part of a horizontally merged set of cells in a table. The val attribute on this element determines how this cell is defined with respect to the previous cell in the table (i.e. does this cell continue the horizontal merge or start a new merged group of cells). 
[Note: This property is maintained for compatibility with legacy word processing documents which defined tables in this manner. Whenever possible, this form or horizontal merges should not be produced, and should be translated to the appropriate gridSpan (§2.4.13) settings on the table cells instead. end note] 
If this element is omitted, then this cell shall not be part of any horizontally merged grouping of cells, and any horizontal merge group in the preceding cells shall be closed. 
[Example: Consider a table with one row and three columns with the last two columns horizontally merged:

This element is used to draw an image that has been loaded from an external source.  There is an implied rectangle that is the same size as the image.  Any stroke or fill is applied to this implied rectangle.  The stroke is drawn on top of the image.  The fill is behind the image and therefore only visible through transparent areas of the image.  Image transparency is either encoded in the file or defined via a color value using the chromakey attribute.  Unlike the image element (§6.1.2.10), the imagedata element must have a parent element.

This element specifies the languages which shall be used to check spelling and grammar (if requested) when processing the contents of this run.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then the languages for the contents of this run shall be automatically determined based on their contents using any method desired. 
Example: Consider a run which contains both Latin and complex script characters in its contents. If those contents should be interpreted as French (Canada) and Hebrew, respectively, that requirement would be specified as follows in the resulting WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:r&lt; 
  &lt;w:rPr&lt;
    &lt;w:lang w:val="fr-CA" w:bidi="he-IL" /&lt; 
  &lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
&lt;/w:r&lt; 
The resulting run specifies that any complex script contents shall be spell and grammar checked as if they were Hebrew, and any Latin character contents shall be spell and grammar checked as if they were French (Canada).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

The size that is specified by this element affects the size of the pictures or table cells relative to the size of text in the document. The pixels per inch (ppi) measurement is relative to the screen resolution, and the resulting  physical dimensions of the resulting image or cell in pixels (which are used in web pages, but not for printed documents) are the result of the original dimensions (in inches) multiplied by the number of pixels per inch. 
The range of values for this element is typically from 19 to 480 pixels per inch. The common settings for popular screen sizes are 72, 96, and 120 pixels per inch. 
If this element is omitted, then a default size of 96 pixels per inch shall be used when determining the number of pixels for images and/or table cells within this document. 
[Note: This setting is typically only specified if the target screen resolution for the web page is known, as defined by the targetScreenSz element (§2.15.2.41) to set the optimum screen size for the web page. end note] [Example: Consider a WordprocessingML document which contains the following content within the web settings part:

        <descriptionfilespec>Right Paragraph Border
This element specifies the border which shall be displayed on the right side of the page around the specified paragraph. 
To determine if any two adjoining paragraphs should have a right border which spans the full line height or not, the right border shall be drawn between the top border or between border at the top (whichever would be rendered for the current paragraph), and the bottom border or between border at the bottom (whichever would be rendered for the current paragraph). 
If this element is omitted on a given paragraph, its value is determined by the setting previously set at any level of the style hierarchy (i.e. that previous setting remains unchanged). If this setting is never specified in the style hierarchy, then no right border shall be applied.
Example: &lt;w:right w:val="single" w:sz="24" w:space="4" w:color="C3D69B" w:themeColor="accent3" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;

        <descriptionfilespec>SmallCaps:
This element specifies that all small letter characters in this text run shall be formatted for display only as their capital letter character equivalents in a font size two points smaller than the actual font size specified for this text. This property does not affect any non-alphabetic character in this run, and does not change the Unicode character for lowercase text, only the method in which it is displayed. If this font cannot be made two point smaller than the current size, then it shall be displayed as the smallest possible font size in capital letters. 
This formatting property is a toggle property, which specifies that its behavior differs between its use within a style definition and its use as direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice versa). Setting it to false (or an equivalent) shall result in the current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as direct formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the absolute state of the resulting property.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then the characters are not formatted as capital letters.
Example:
&lt;w:r&lt; 
    &lt;w:sz w:val="24" /&lt; 
    &lt;w:smallCaps w:val="true" /&lt;

This element specifies that the contents of this run shall be displayed with a single horizontal line through the center of the line. 
This formatting property is a toggle property, which specifies that its behavior differs between its use within a style definition and its use as direct formatting. When used as part of a style definition, setting this property shall toggle the current state of that property as specified up to this point in the hierarchy (i.e. applied to not applied, and vice versa). Setting it to false (or an equivalent) shall result in the current setting remaining unchanged. However, when used as direct formatting, setting this property to true or false shall set the absolute state of the resulting property.  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then strikethrough shall not be applied to the contents of this run. 
This element shall not be present with the dstrike (§2.3.2.7) property on the same run, since they are mutually exclusive in terms of appearance. 
Example: Consider a run of text which shall have the strike property explicitly turned on for the contents of the 
run. This constraint is specified using the following WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:rPr&lt; 
  &lt;w:strike w:val="true"/&lt; 
&lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
This run explicitly declares that the strike property is true, so the contents of this run will have a single horizontal strikethrough line.

                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <descriptionfilespec>This simple type specifies a theme color to be applied to the current object. The specified theme color is a reference to one of the predefined theme colors, located in the document's Theme part, which allows color information to be set centrally in the document. 
[Example: Consider a set of borders configured to use the accent2 theme color, resulting in the following WordprocessingML markup: 
&lt;w:top … w:color="FFA8A0" w:themeColor="accent2" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;
&lt;w:bottom … w:color="FFA8A0" w:themeColor="accent2" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;

&lt;w:right … w:color="FFA8A0" w:themeColor="accent2" w:themeTint="99" /&lt;
The borders have a themeColor attribute of type ST_ThemeColor that when specified, imports the accent2 theme color specified for this document. end example] This simple type's contents are a restriction of the XML Schema string datatype. [cit. OOXML spec.]</descriptionfilespec>

This element specifies that the contents of this run should be displayed along with an underline appearing directly below the character height (less all spacing above and below the characters on the line).  
If this element is not present, the default value is to leave the formatting applied at previous level in the style hierarchy. If this element is never applied in the style hierarchy, then an underline shall not be applied to the contents of this run. 
Example: Consider a run of text which shall have a double underline explicitly turned on for the contents of the run. This constraint is specified using the following WordprocessingML: 
&lt;w:rPr&lt; 
  &lt;w:u w:val="double"/&lt; 
&lt;/w:rPr&lt; 
The val of the underline on this run is double, so the style of the underline on this run shall be a double line
This run explicitly declares an underline using the u property. The val of that underline is double, so the style of the underline on this run shall be a double line.
Possible Values:

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. N indicates the n-grams used for comparison. Default setting is N=1. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. N indicates the n-grams used for comparison. Default setting is N=1. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                <mDescription>
                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <descriptionfilespec>An Indexed color space allows a PDF content stream to use small integers as indices into a color map or color table of arbitrary colors in some other space. A PDF consumer application treats each sample value as an index into the color table and uses the color value it finds there. This technique can considerably reduce the amount of data required to represent a sampled image—for example, by using 8-bit index values as samples instead of 24-bit RGB color values. An Indexed color space is defined by a four-element array: [ /Indexed base hival lookup ] 
The first element is the color space family name Indexed. The remaining elements are parameters that an Indexed color space requires. Setting the current stroking or nonstroking color space to an Indexed color space initializes the corresponding current color to 0. [cit.]</descriptionfilespec>

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <descriptionfilespec>Round join. A circle with a diameter equal to the line width is drawn around the point where the two segments meet and is ﬁlled in, producing a rounded corner. 
Note: If path segments shorter than half the line width meet at a sharp angle, an unintended “wrong side” of the circle may appear.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                <mDescription>
                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values

99 72 82 77

The cHRM chunk may be used to specify the 1931 CIE x,y chromaticities of the red, green, and blue display primaries used in the image, and the referenced white point. See Annex C: Gamma and chromaticity for more information. The iCCP and sRGB chunks provide more sophisticated support for colour management and control.

The cHRM chunk contains:
White point x 	4 bytes
White point y 	4 bytes
Red x 	4 bytes
Red y 	4 bytes
Green x 	4 bytes
Green y 	4 bytes
Blue x 	4 bytes
Blue y 	4 bytes

Each value is encoded as a four-byte PNG unsigned integer, representing the x or y value times 100000.

EXAMPLE A value of 0.3127 would be stored as the integer 31270.

The cHRM chunk is allowed in all PNG datastreams, although it is of little value for greyscale images.</descriptionfilespec>

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <descriptionfilespec>cHRM Primary chromaticities and white point

The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values

99 72 82 77

The cHRM chunk may be used to specify the 1931 CIE x,y chromaticities of the red, green, and blue display primaries used in the image, and the referenced white point. See Annex C: Gamma and chromaticity for more information. The iCCP and sRGB chunks provide more sophisticated support for colour management and control.

The cHRM chunk contains:
White point x 	4 bytes
White point y 	4 bytes
Red x 	4 bytes
Red y 	4 bytes
Green x 	4 bytes
Green y 	4 bytes
Blue x 	4 bytes
Blue y 	4 bytes

Each value is encoded as a four-byte PNG unsigned integer, representing the x or y value times 100000.

EXAMPLE A value of 0.3127 would be stored as the integer 31270.

The cHRM chunk is allowed in all PNG datastreams, although it is of little value for greyscale images.</descriptionfilespec>

The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values

99 72 82 77

The cHRM chunk may be used to specify the 1931 CIE x,y chromaticities of the red, green, and blue display primaries used in the image, and the referenced white point. See Annex C: Gamma and chromaticity for more information. The iCCP and sRGB chunks provide more sophisticated support for colour management and control.

The cHRM chunk contains:
White point x 	4 bytes
White point y 	4 bytes
Red x 	4 bytes
Red y 	4 bytes
Green x 	4 bytes
Green y 	4 bytes
Blue x 	4 bytes
Blue y 	4 bytes

Each value is encoded as a four-byte PNG unsigned integer, representing the x or y value times 100000.

EXAMPLE A value of 0.3127 would be stored as the integer 31270.

The cHRM chunk is allowed in all PNG datastreams, although it is of little value for greyscale images.</descriptionfilespec>

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values

112 72 89 115

The pHYs chunk specifies the intended pixel size or aspect ratio for display of the image. It contains:
Pixels per unit, X axis 	4 bytes (PNG unsigned integer)
Pixels per unit, Y axis 	4 bytes (PNG unsigned integer)
Unit specifier 	1 byte

The following values are defined for the unit specifier:
0 	unit is unknown
1 	unit is the metre

When the unit specifier is 0, the pHYs chunk defines pixel aspect ratio only; the actual size of the pixels remains unspecified.

If the pHYs chunk is not present, pixels are assumed to be square, and the physical size of each pixel is unspecified.</descriptionfilespec>

The four-byte chunk type field contains the decimal values

115 66 73 84

To simplify decoders, PNG specifies that only certain sample depths may be used, and further specifies that sample values should be scaled to the full range of possible values at the sample depth. The sBIT chunk defines the original number of significant bits (which can be less than or equal to the sample depth). This allows PNG decoders to recover the original data losslessly even if the data had a sample depth not directly supported by PNG.

The sBIT chunk contains:
Colour type 0

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

        <descriptionfilespec>Mirrors the essentials of PostScript's path creation functionality.
Most operators can be easily translated into PostScript, and, conversely, any PostScript path can be represented as a TIFF ClipPath. However, the TIFF ClipPath list of operators is not identical to the current list of PostScript operators; for simplicity, some of the PostScript variants have been dropped, and a few operators, such as polyto and rpolyto have been added. polyto and rpolyto were added in order to make complex TIFF polygonal clip paths more compact.

                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                <mDescription>
                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

Specifies that each pixel has N extra components whose interpretation is defined by one of the values listed below. When this field is used, the SamplesPerPixel field has a value greater than the PhotometricInterpretation field suggests.

For example, full-color RGB data normally has SamplesPerPixel=3. If SamplesPerPixel is greater than 3, then the ExtraSamples field describes the meaning of the extra samples. If SamplesPerPixel is, say, 5 then ExtraSamples will contain 2 values, one for each extra sample. ExtraSamples is typically used to include non-color information, such as opacity, in an image. The possible values for each item in the field's value are:

0 = Unspecified data
1 = Associated alpha data (with pre-multiplied color)
2 = Unassociated alpha data [cit. TIFF 6.0] [Compatibility: TIFF 6.0]</descriptionfilespec>

LibTiff name		TIFFTAG_FILLORDER
Type		SHORT
Count		1
Default		1 (lower column values in higher order bits)
Description:
The logical order of bits within a byte.
The specification defines these values:
1 = pixels with lower column values are stored in the higher-order bits of the byte. 2 = pixels with lower column values are stored in the lower-order bits of the byte.
The specification goes on to warn that FillOrder=2 should not be used in some cases to avoid ambigouty, and that support for FillOrder=2 is not required in Baseline TIFF compliant readers.
LibTiff defines these values:
FILLORDER_MSB2LSB = 1;
FILLORDER_LSB2MSB = 2;
In practice, the use of FillOrder=2 is very uncommon, and is not recommended.</descriptionfilespec>

Because optical density is specified in terms of fractional numbers, this field is necessary to interpret the stored integer information. For example, if
GrayScaleResponseUnits is set to 4 (ten-thousandths of a unit), and a  GrayScaleResponseCurve number for gray level 4 is 3455, then the resulting
actual value is 0.3455. 
Optical densitometers typically measure densities within the range of 0.0 to 2.0.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. N indicates the n-grams used for comparison. Default setting is N=1. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. N indicates the n-grams used for comparison. Default setting is N=1. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).

                    The Levenshtein distance (syn. Edit distance) is a distance measure for strings. Two strings are compared with respect to the three basic operations insert, delete and replace in order to transform string A into string B. The value for this metric is the number of operations needed for transformation.

                <mDescription>
                    Simple match coefficient is a distance measure that uses the hamming distance. In addition, the ratio of non-corresponding values (hamming distance) to the total number of compared pairs of values is calculated. The result is a rational number from range 0.0 to 1.0, indicating maximum similarity (0.0) to minimum (1.0).
